# Collaborative-filtering-for-Music-recommendation

***This repo uses Collaborative filtering for Music Recommendation***

***The basic idea behind Collaborative filtering is :: 

We can predict and recommend items to users based on the preference similarities
There are basically 2 types of Collaborative filtering techniques:

* User-based Collaborative filtering
* Content-based Collaboraive filtering

***I have implemented both these techniques in R.***

**Datasets used :**

I have used only the data from Germany as the dataset is quite huge. And, also for simplicity.
